verify-command: 
source-ask: If an API is involved, the user must validate whether an API doc or SDK exists and whether it's provided. This is a hard gate (no-op): archkit blocks further development/direction until the API doc/SDK is given OR the API documentation is referenced properly before coding starts. The user must explicitly override to proceed without docs; otherwise it stays gated.

# Finalize: changelog, docs, commits + release

## Why
Auto-appended by archkit (cgr.finalize) so this batch ends with its release chores in a fresh context: update the changelog, update documentation, finalize commits with notes/comments, push to remote. CI/CD: github-actions. archkit never runs git/deploy itself — do the local steps and instruct the user for push/release/deploy. Adjust or opt out with archkit_finalize_config (or `archkit finalize`).
